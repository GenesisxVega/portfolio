<h2>Biography</h2>
<h3 id="#About-Me">About Me</h3>
<p>Bonjour! Hola! Hello! Welcome to my portfolio. My name is Genesis Vega Gonzalez and I am currently studying UX Design at SAIT. Prior to studying design, I was an elementary school teacher for 2 years. I am hoping that in this new career, my creativity and ingenuity will further blossom. Moreover, I was born in Chile and moved to Canada at the age of 5. I am fluent in French, Spanish, and English. Hopefully, I will be able to work in different parts of the world to utilize my languages.</p>
